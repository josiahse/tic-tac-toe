# Tic Tac Toe

This is a very rudimentary implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The user, playing as x's, goes first. The computer will then randomly choose from one of the available tiles. When a winner is found it will be declared.

## To-Do's:
+ Add mobile design
+ Allow toggle for two players
+ Stretch goal: add some sort of machine learning to allow the computer to make informed moves instead of random ones.
